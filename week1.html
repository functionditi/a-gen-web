    <p>“The direction and set of instructions for creating a work of art is just as important as the art itself.” </p>
      <p>I find the way Lewitt plays with scale to be very interesting. On a tiny laptop screen, we peer into the work, but on a larger scale, it seems much more experimental and looming.

      I also like the collaborative nature of his work. The set of instructions an be executed by anyone, and the final outcomes will never be the same. There’s never a sense of finality, a full stop, and his work can live on and on. A very cool legacy to have.
